{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}

module Language.Java.Lexical.Preprocess where

{-
  Java spec requires that:

  - (ยง3.2) Unicode escape to be performed as the first step of lexical analysis.
  - (ยง3.2) Line terminators to be treated the same.
  - (ยง3.3) There may be an optional ASCII Sub as the last character of input stream,
    which is to be ignored.

  This module serves as a preprocessing step to do those things prior to
  passing input to Alex.

  According to my understading of the spec spec,
  for \u0000 ~ \uFFFF, we just need to map them to corresponding
  chars, and we don't need to deal with surrogate pairs, which simplifies
  preprocessing.

  This plays nicely with Alex since in Alex,
